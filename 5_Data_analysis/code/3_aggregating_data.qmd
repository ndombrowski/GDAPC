# Aggregating data

- **Aggregation** means collecting or gathering many separate pieces into a whole. 
- **Data aggregation** is the process of gathering data from multiple sources in order to combine it into a single summarized collection. 
- In data analytics, **a summarized collection**, or summary, describes identifying the data you need and gathering it all together in one place. 


## VLOOKUP (spreadsheets)

### Cleanup

**VALUE** is a function that converts a text string that represents a number to a numerical value.

`=VALUE(A4)`

**TRIM** automatically deletes any extra spaces added to the cell.

`=TRIM(A4)`

Remove duplicates with `remove duplictes`


### VLOOKUP in action

**VLOOKUP** stands for vertical lookup. Basically, it's a function that searches for a certain value in a column to return a corresponding piece of information. The basic syntax looks like follows:

`=VLOOKUP(103, A2:B26, 2, FALSE)`

Here:

- 103 is the value to search for
- A2:B26 is the range that will be searched
- VLOOKUP will not recognize column names such as A, B, or C. We use a number to indicate the column, i.e. we want to search for a match in the 2nd column that we want to add
- FALSE tells VLOOKUP to find an exact match. If this said true, the function will return only a close match

Another example for finding matching data in another sheet:

`=vlookup(A2, 'Employee Rates'!$A$2:$B$5,2, FALSE)`

Be sure to put single quotation marks around the spreadsheet name and add an exclamation point after it. This is the way to reference the other spreadsheet.

We can also search using words

`=VLOOKUP("Nigeria", A2:C10, 2, false)`


### Potential issues

- VLOOKUP only returns the first match it finds
- VLOOKUP can only return a value from the data to the right. It can't look left. So for this to work, we have to move the data around
- Let's say the first few rows of a VLOOKUP have returned the correct result. But when you drive the function down the column, problems start popping up. This is probably because the table array part of the function hasn't been locked or made absolute. An **absolute reference** is a reference that is locked so that rows and columns won't change when copied. You can fix this issue by wrapping the table array in dollar signs.
- Locking the spreadsheet. This stops other people from making changes and breaking functions.
- If the spreadsheet needs to be shared you can use **MATCH**, which is a function used to locate the position of a specific lookup value and can help you with version control.

## Aggregating in SQL

### The importance of aliases

**Aliases** are used in SQL queries to create temporary names for a column or table. Aliasing is the process of using aliases. In SQL queries, aliases are implemented by making use of the AS command and often make things more readable. 

```{sql}
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
from table_name;
```


- [SQL Aliases](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp): This tutorial on aliasing is a really useful resource to have when you start practicing writing queries and aliasing tables on your own. It also demonstrates how aliasing works with real tables. 
- [SQL Alias](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-alias/): This detailed introduction to aliasing includes multiple examples. This is another great resource to reference if you need more examples. 
- [Using Column Aliasing](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&cdcVersion=9.4_3.5&docsetId=sqlproc&docsetTarget=p0aymxwsvbt5wcn1lncugwjtf758.htm&locale=en): This is a guide that focuses on column aliasing specifically. Generally, you will be aliasing entire tables, but if you find yourself needing to alias just a column, this is a great resource to have bookmarked.  




### JOINs

Examples were run in BiqQuery using `data/employees_table.csv` and `data/departments_table.csv`

**JOIN** is a SQL clause that's used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

Types of join:

<img width=400 src="../images/joins.png">

- An inner JOIN is a function that returns records with matching values in both tables. When we input JOIN into SQL, it usually defaults to inner JOIN
- A LEFT JOIN is a function that will return all the records from the left table and only the matching records from the right table. 
- RIGHT JOIN does the opposite. It will return all records from the right table and only the matching records from the left. 
- OUTER join combines RIGHT and LEFT JOIN to return all matching records in both tables. This means it will return all records in both tables.

Let's get a list of employees with their department name, excluding any employee without a department ID. the The department ID record is used in both tables, so we can use an INNER JOIN to return a list with only those employees.

```{sql}
SELECT 
  --- give column names
  employees.name AS employee_name,
  employees.role AS employee_role,
  departments.name AS department_name
FROM 
  employee_data.employees
INNER JOIN
  employee_data.departments 
  ---specify which column and each table will contain the matching JOIN key 
  ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id
```

Now, let's try out one last JOIN: OUTER. OUTER JOIN will fetch all of the employee names and departments.

```{sql}
SELECT 
  --- give column names
  employees.name AS employee_name,
  employees.role AS employee_role,
  departments.name AS department_name
FROM 
  employee_data.employees
FULL OUTER JOIN
  employee_data.departments 
  ---specify which column and each table will contain the matching JOIN key 
  ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id
```

Another example on the public dataset `world_bank_intl_education`

```{sql}
SELECT 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`.country_name, 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary`.country_code, 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`.value
FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`
INNER JOIN 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary` 
ON `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary`.country_code = `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education`.country_code
```

This basic query joins the tables on the country_code foreign key, and returns the country name, country code, and value column. This is quite a long, unwieldy query for such a basic result! The length of each table name (which must include the full address for each table for BigQuery to know where to pull the data from) makes this hard to read and work with. 

However, you can solve this by setting an alias for each table.

```{sql}
SELECT 
    edu.country_name,
    summary.country_code,
    edu.value
FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education` AS edu
INNER JOIN 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary` AS summary
ON edu.country_code = summary.country_code
```

Now that you’ve confirmed that the JOIN statement works, try to answer an actual data question using this dataset. What is the average amount of money spent per region on education? Copy, paste, and run the following query: 

```{sql}
SELECT 
    AVG(edu.value) average_value, summary.region
FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.international_education` AS edu
INNER JOIN 
    `bigquery-public-data.world_bank_intl_education.country_summary` AS summary
ON edu.country_code = summary.country_code
WHERE summary.region IS NOT null
GROUP BY summary.region
ORDER BY average_value DESC
```

## COUNT and COUNT DISTINCT

These examples were run in BigQuery with `data/warehouse.csv` and `data/orders.csv`

**COUNT** is a query that returns the number of rows in a specified range, but **COUNT DISTINCT** is a little different. COUNT DISTINCT is a query that only returns the distinct values in that range. 

From this query, we're actually going to start with a FROM statement so that we can alias our tables. **Aliasing** is when you temporarily name a table or column in your query to make it easier to read and write.

```{sql}
SELECT 
  orders.*,
  warehouse.warehouse_alias,
  warehouse.state
---create aliases for our tables
FROM
  warehouse_orders.Orders AS orders
--we need both the warehouse details and the order details because we want to report on the distribution of orders by state
JOIN
  warehouse_orders.Warehouse AS warehouse ON
  orders.warehouse_id = warehouse.warehouse_id
```

Now, we want to count how many states are in our ordered data.

```{sql}
SELECT 
  COUNT(warehouse.state) AS num_states
FROM
---create aliases for our table
  warehouse_orders.Orders AS orders
--we need both the warehouse details and the order details because we want to report on the distribution of orders by state
JOIN
  warehouse_orders.Warehouse AS warehouse ON
  orders.warehouse_id = warehouse.warehouse_id
```

Wait, that's not quite right. This query returned over 9,000 states because we counted every single row that included a state. But we actually want to count the distinct states. 

```{sql}
SELECT 
  COUNT (DISTINCT warehouse.state) AS num_states
FROM
---create aliases for our table
  warehouse_orders.Orders AS orders
--we need both the warehouse details and the order details because we want to report on the distribution of orders by state
JOIN
  warehouse_orders.Warehouse AS warehouse ON
  orders.warehouse_id = warehouse.warehouse_id
```

According to these results, we have three distinct states in our Orders data. 

Let's check out what happens when we group by the state column in the warehouse table

```{sql}
SELECT 
  warehouse.state AS state,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS num_orders
FROM
---create aliases for our table
  warehouse_orders.Orders AS orders
--we need both the warehouse details and the order details because we want to report on the distribution of orders by state
JOIN
  warehouse_orders.Warehouse AS warehouse ON
  orders.warehouse_id = warehouse.warehouse_id
GROUP BY 
  warehouse.state
```

Now we have three rows, one of each state represented in the Orders data. And our COUNT DISTINCT on the number of orders sums up the count we ran earlier: 9,999.


## Subqueries

A **subquery** is a SQL query that is nested inside of a larger query. 

With subqueries you can combine different pieces of logic together. Because the logic of your outer query relies on the inner query, you can get more done with a single query. This means all of the logic is in one place, which makes it more efficient and easier to read.

The statement containing the subquery can also be called the **outer query** or the outer select. This makes the subquery the **inner query** or inner select. 

The inner query executes first so that the results can be passed on to the outer query to use. 

There are a few rules that subqueries must follow:

- Subqueries must be enclosed within parentheses
- A subquery can have only one column specified in the SELECT clause. But if you want a subquery to compare multiple columns, those columns must be selected in the main query.
- Subqueries that return more than one row can only be used with multiple value operators, such as the IN operator which allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
- A subquery can’t be nested in a SET command. The SET command is used with UPDATE to specify which columns (and values) are to be updated in a table.

### Examples
These examples you use the public data new_york and citibike_stations.

For the first statement, let's say we want to compare the number of bikes available at a station to the average number of bikes available. We're going to use this query to pull the average number of bikes available. Then we're going to incorporate it as a subquery.

We want to select the station ID and the number of bikes available. Then we'll put the SELECT query that's pulling the average number of bikes inside that outer query by using parentheses.

```{sql}
SELECT  
  station_id, 
  num_bikes_available,
  (SELECT
    AVG(num_bikes_available)
  FROM
    bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations) AS avg_num_bikes_available
FROM 
  bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations
```

It's really common to see subqueries nested in FROM and WHERE statements. So let's try those next. We could use a FROM statement to calculate the number of rides that have started at each station over time.

```{sql}
SELECT
  station_id,
  name,
  number_of_rides AS number_of_rides_starting_at_station
FROM
  (
    SELECT start_station_id,
      COUNT(*) AS number_of_rides
    FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips
    GROUP BY start_station_id
  )
  AS station_num_trips
  INNER JOIN

  bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations ON station_id = start_station_id
  ORDER BY number_of_rides DESC
```

Let's use a WHERE statement. The bike-sharing company has two kinds of users: subscribers and one-time customers. Let's say we wanted a list of stations subscribers used.

```{sql}
SELECT
  station_id, 
  name
FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations
WHERE 
  ---use IN so that we can specify multiple values and this WHERE statement
  station_id IN
  --- put subquery in parenthesis to tell we only want data on specific customers
  (SELECT start_station_id
  FROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips
  WHERE usertype = 'Subscriber')
```


## Using subqueries to aggregate data

We've used functions like WHERE to filter our data before, but the WHERE function can't be used with aggregate functions. For example, you can use WHERE on a statement and follow it with GROUP BY. 

But when you want to use GROUP BY first and then use WHERE on that output, you'll need a different function. This is where HAVING comes in. **HAVING** basically allows you to add a filter to your query instead of the underlying table when you're working with aggregate functions. 

Similarly, **CASE** returns records with your conditions by allowing you to include if/then statements in your query.

For this example, we use the warehouse_orders previously loaded in BiqQuery

We've been asked to calculate what percentage of the orders are fulfilled by each warehouse. Basically, we're interested in knowing which warehouses are delivering the most orders.

```{sql}
SELECT 
  --- decide what to select (3rd)
  Warehouse.warehouse_id,
  ---use concat to get a unique warehouse name
  CONCAT(Warehouse.state, ": ", Warehouse.warehouse_alias) AS warehouse_name,
  --- get nr of orders per warehouse
  COUNT(Orders.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
  ---add subquery to pull the total nr of orders
  (SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM warehouse_orders.Orders as Orders)
    --- close subquery and name column
    AS total_orders,
    -- use a CASE statement to create categories for our warehouses
    CASE 
      WHEN COUNT(Orders.order_id)/ (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM warehouse_orders.Orders AS Orders) <= 0.2
      THEN "filfilled 0-20% of Orders"
      WHEN COUNT(Orders.order_id)/ (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM warehouse_orders.Orders AS Orders) > 0.2
      AND COUNT(Orders.order_id)/ (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM warehouse_orders.Orders AS Orders) <= 0.6
      THEN "fulfilled 21-60% of Orders"
    ELSE "fulfilled more than 60% of Orders"
    END AS fulfillment_summary
---add aliases (ideally write first to make the rest easier)
FROM warehouse_orders.Warehouse AS Warehouse
--- Join with orders and add alias (write second)
LEFT JOIN warehouse_orders.Orders AS Orders ON Orders.warehouse_id = Warehouse.warehouse_id
GROUP BY Warehouse.warehouse_id, warehouse_name
--- remove orders from warehouses that are not yet running
HAVING COUNT(Orders.order_id) > 0
```
