Programming languages have their own set of rules for how these words and symbols should be used, called **syntax**. **Coding** is writing instructions to the computer in the syntax of a specific programming language.\n\n**R** is a programming language frequently used for statistical analysis, visualization and other data analysis. R is based on another programming language named S. In the 1970s, John Chambers created S for internal use at Bell Labs, a famous scientific research facility. The title R refers to the first names of its two authors and plays on a single- letter title of its predecessor S. \n\n**RStudio**'s an IDE or integrated development environment. This means that RStudio brings together all the tools you might want to use in a single place. There are two main ways of writing code in RStudio: using the console or using the source editor. You can type commands directly into the console, but they'll be forgotten when you close your current session. \n\n**Packages** are units of reproducible R code. Members of the R community create packages to keep track of the R functions that they write and reuse. Packages offer a helpful combination of code, reusable R functions, descriptive documentation, tests for checking your code, and sample data sets. \n\nThe lubridate package that you are about to install is part of the tidyverse. The **tidyverse** is a collection of packages in R with a common design philosophy for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. For a lot of data analysts, the tidyverse is an essential tool. You will learn more about the tidyverse later on in this course.\n\n\n## Installing packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Loading a library\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# | warning: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n",
