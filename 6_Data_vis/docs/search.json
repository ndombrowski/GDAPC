    "text": "Data visualization is the graphic representation and presentation of data.\n\nThe McCandless Method lists four elements of good data visualization:\n\n\nInformation: the data you are working with\nStory: a clear and compelling narrative or concept\nGoal: a specific objective or function for the visual\nVisual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression\n\n\nKaiser Fung’s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup\n\nThis approach is a useful set of questions that can help consumers of data visualization critique what they are consuming and determine how effective it is. The Checkup has three questions:\n\nWhat is the practical question?\nWhat does the data say?\nWhat does the visual say?\n\n\n\nPre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels.\nMarks are basic visual objects like points, lines, and shapes. Every mark can be broken down into four qualities:\n\nPosition - Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks\nSize - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is\nShape - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it\nColor - What color the mark is\n\nChannels are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data. Channels are basically marks that have been used to visualize data. Channels will vary in terms of how effective they are at communicating data based on three elements:\n\nAccuracy - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented? For example, color is very accurate when communicating categorical differences, like apples and oranges. But it is much less effective when distinguishing quantitative data like 5 from 5.5.\nPopout - How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others? There are many ways of drawing attention to specific parts of a visual, and many of them leverage pre-attentive attributes like line length, size, line width, shape, enclosure, hue, and intensity.\nGrouping - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data? Consider the proximity, similarity, enclosure, connectedness, and continuity of the channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose the right visual: One of the first things you have to decide is which visual will be the most effective for your audience. Sometimes, a simple table is the best visualization. Other times, you need a more complex visualization to illustrate your point.\nOptimize the data-ink ratio: The data-ink entails focusing on the part of the visual that is essential to understanding the point of the chart. Try to minimize non-data ink like boxes around legends or shadows to optimize the data-ink ratio.\nUse orientation effectively: Make sure the written components of the visual, like the labels on a bar chart, are easy to read. You can change the orientation of your visual to make it easier to read and understand.\nColor: There are a lot of important considerations when thinking about using color in your visuals. These include using color consciously and meaningfully, staying consistent throughout your visuals, being considerate of what colors mean to different people, and using inclusive color scales that make sense for everyone viewing them.\nNumber of things: Think about how many elements you include in any visual. If your visualization uses lines, try to plot five or fewer. If that isn’t possible, use color or hue to emphasize important lines. Also, when using visuals like pie charts, try to keep the number of segments to less than seven since too many elements can be distracting.\n\n\n\n\n\nCutting off the y-axis: Changing the scale on the y-axis can make the differences between different groups in your data seem more dramatic, even if the difference is actually quite small.\nMisleading use of a dual y-axis: Using a dual y-axis without clearly labeling it in your data visualization can create extremely misleading charts\nArtificially limiting the scope of the data: If you only consider the part of the data that confirms your analysis, your visualizations will be misleading because they don’t take all of the data into account\nProblematic choices in how data is binned or grouped: It is important to make sure that the way you are grouping data isn’t misleading or misrepresenting your data and disguising important trends and insights\nUsing part-to-whole visuals when the totals do not sum up appropriately : If you are using a part-to-whole visual like a pie chart to explain your data, the individual parts should add up to equal 100%. If they don’t, your data visualization will be misleading.\nHiding trends in cumulative charts: Creating a cumulative chart can disguise more insightful trends by making the scale of the visualization too large to track any changes over time\nArtificially smoothing trends: Adding smooth trend lines between points in a scatter plot can make it easier to read that plot, but replacing the points with just the line can actually make it appear that the point is more connected over time than it actually was\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beauty of data visualization: In this video, David McCandless explains the need for design to not just be beautiful, but for it to be meaningful as well. Data visualization must be able to balance function and form for it to be relevant to your audience.\n‘The McCandless Method’ of data presentation: At first glance, this blog appears to be written by a David McCandless fan, and it is. However, it contains very useful information and provides an in-depth look at the 5-step process that McCandless uses to present his data.\nInformation is beautiful: Founded by McCandless himself, this site serves as a hub of sample visualizations that make use of the McCandless method. Explore data from the news, science, the economy, and so much more and learn how to make visual decisions based on facts from all kinds of sources.\nBeautiful daily news: In this McCandless collection, explore uplifting trends and statistics that are beautifully visualized for your creative enjoyment. A new chart is released every day so be sure to visit often to absorb the amazing things happening all over the world.\nThe Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics: The Dos and Don’ts of Presenting Data, Facts, and Figures: This is a comprehensive guide to data visualization, including chapters on basic data visualization principles and how to create useful data visualizations even when you find yourself in a tricky situation. This is a useful book to add to your data visualization library, and you can reference it over and over again.\nThe data visualization catalogue: Not sure where to start with data visualization? This catalogue features a range of different diagrams, charts, and graphs to help you find the best fit for your project. As you navigate each category, you will get a detailed description of each visualization as well as its function and a list of similar visuals.\n10 data visualization blogs: Each link will lead you to a blog that is a fountain of information on everything from data storytelling to graphic data.

They are mainly used to show relationships between two variables and use a system of color-coding to represent different values.\nLine graphs are a type of visualization that can help your audience understand shifts or changes in your data. They’re usually used to track changes through a period of time, but they can be paired with other factors too.\nPie charts show how much each part of something makes up the whole.\nMaps help organize data geographically. The great thing about maps is they can hold a lot of location-based information and they’re easy for your audience to interpret.\nA distribution graph displays the spread of various outcomes in a dataset.\nA histogram resembles a bar graph, but it’s a chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges.\nCorrelation charts can show relationships among data, but they should be used with caution because they might lead viewers to think that the data shows causation. Causation or a cause-effect relationship occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome.\nScatter plots show relationships between different variables. Scatter plots are typically used for two variables for a set of data, although additional variables can be displayed."

    "section": "2.6 Principles of design",
    "text": "2.6 Principles of design\n\nBalance: The design of a data visualization is balanced when the key visual elements, like color and shape, are distributed evenly.\nEmphasis: Your data visualization should have a focal point, so that your audience knows where to concentrate. In other words, your visualizations should emphasize the most important data so that users recognize it first. Using color and value is one effective way to make this happen.\nMovement: Movement can refer to the path the viewer’s eye travels as they look at a data visualization, or literal movement created by animations. Movement in data visualization should mimic the way people usually read. You can use lines and colors to pull the viewer’s attention across the page.\nPattern: You can use similar shapes and colors to create patterns in your data visualization. This can be useful in a lot of different ways. For example, you can use patterns to highlight similarities between different data sets, or break up a pattern with a unique shape, color, or line to create more emphasis.\nRepetition: Repeating chart types, shapes, or colors adds to the effectiveness of your visualization.\nProportion: Proportion is another way that you can demonstrate the importance of certain data. Using various colors and sizes helps demonstrate that you are calling attention to a specific visual over others. If you make one chart in a dashboard larger than the others, then you are calling attention to it.\nRhythm: This refers to creating a sense of movement or flow in your visualization. Rhythm is closely tied to the movement principle. If your finished design doesn’t successfully create a flow, you might want to rearrange some of the elements to improve the rhythm.\nVariety: Your visualizations should have some variety in the chart types, lines, shapes, colors, and values you use. Variety keeps the audience engaged.\nUnity: The last principle is unity. This means that your final data visualization should be cohesive. If the visual is disjointed or not well organized, it will be confusing and overwhelming.\n\nData composition, and it’s achieved by combining the individual parts of a visualization and displaying them together as a whole\nElements for effective visuals:\n\nClear meaning\nSophisticated use of contrast\nRefined execution, i.e. deep attention to detail"

The typography and placement of the headline is important too. It’s best to keep it simple. Make it bold or a few sizes larger than the rest of the text and place it directly above the chart, aligned to the left.\nA subtitle supports the headline by adding more context and description. Use a font style that matches the rest of the charts elements and place the subtitle directly underneath the headline.\nA legend or key identifies the meaning of various elements in a data visualization and can be used as an alternative to labeling data directly. Direct labeling like this keeps your audience’s attention fixed on your graphic and helps them identify data quickly.\nAn annotation briefly explains data or helps focus the audience on a particular aspect of the data in a visualization."

Anyone can create visualizations using either Tableau Desktop Professional Edition or the free Tableau Public Edition.\nFor this course we’re using Tableau Public in browser, which is free. Create account at: public.tableau.com. To follow the first examples use this link\nTo work with data, click on the World Happiness data and click the button in the top right to make a copy. At this point, Tableau will save a copy of this workbook to your own profile so you can create your own visualizations. Now that you’re working in your own copy, create a new worksheet so you can build a data viz from scratch. You’ll click on Worksheet in the top menu and then New Worksheet. To start building your data viz, add country as a detail in the marks shelf. You can do this by dragging the country table over to the detail icon. This sets up your viz as a world map to represent the data in the table.\nNext, add the happiness score to the color on the mark shelf. This applies a color scheme to the viz, in this case shades of blue. So, to adjust the colors, click the color menu and click edit colors. Then change the color scheme to green, blue, diverging and check the box for stepped colors, which shows a clear difference between the highest and lowest happiness score.\nBecause there are three years of data in the table we’re using, you can filter the data to only include 2016. So, we’ll add year to the filter shelf. Then we’ll choose to filter by year and we’ll select 2016.\nWe can also focus our visualization on one region, the European region. To do this, move your cursor to the left part of the map to find the view toolbar. Use the tools in this toolbar to pan to and zoom in on the European region.\nUse the lasso selection tool to select just a few countries. Keep only, this applies another filter this time to the country you’re including in your viz. \nTo make your viz even better, add the happiness score as a label in the map. You can now see a happiness score for each country on the map. There’s an option to change the data type of the happiness scores from decimals to whole numbers. But when you do this, you lose the contrast that the values with the decimals offers. So, change it back to show the happiness score as a decimal.\nNow, to make it even more interactive, let’s add a filter with a slider. This will allow your audience to filter by happiness score so they can focus on fewer countries.\nBut first, let’s bring in more of the map we started with. To do this, hover on the map and select the zoom home icon in the toolbar to reveal more countries on the map.\nNext, we’re going to add happiness score to the filter shelf. We’ll select all values and click next. Then, for the range of values we’ll click OK to accept the default settings. In the filters shelf, click the drop down to open the menu for the happiness score and select Show Filter.\nResources:\n\nGoogle Career Certificates page on Tableau Public: This gallery contains all of the visualizations created in the video lessons; you can explore these examples more here.\nTableau Public resources page: This links to the resources page, including some how-to videos and sample data.\nTableau user forum: Search for answers and connect with other users in the community on the forum page.\nWhich chart or graph is right for you?

Underneath connections, double click on the sheet’s CO2 data cleaned to load that data into the main part of the screen. You can also drag and drop the sheet into the area where it says drag tables here\nUnderneath connections, double click on the sheet’s CO2 data cleaned to load that data into the main part of the screen.\nClick update now to preview the data you opened in the bottom portion of the screen. By default, Tableau will only show the first 1000 rows in the table, but you can increase the number of rows in the setting above the data view. Each row corresponds to a single data point and each column represents a different feature. Tableau interprets the type of data in each column. Each icon represents a different type of data. For example, a number sign represents numerical data while an abc represents string data. A globe represents geographic data and so on.\nTo start the database, choose the sheet 1 tab in the lower left of the display.On the far left of the screen is a banner with column names above a grey line. In tableau, these are called the dimensions of the data. Below this line are the different measures that you can track for these dimensions.\nTo create a chart that displays the CO2 emissions per country, we’re going to start by double clicking the country name dimension.The main display will show a map of the countries on the planet with dots indicating which countries are represented in the data.\nDouble click or drag and drop onto the sheet the measures CO2 kilotons. This will change the size of the dots to be proportional to the amount of CO2 emitted.Tableau has a wide selection of options for depicting the measures for a given dimension. Most of these options are contained in the middle column between the main display and the columns with dimensions and measures\nNow, let’s customize the look of our chart to better communicate trends in the data. If we drag and drop a measure on one of the marks such as color, size and label, we can change that aspect of the measures visualization on the chart. For instance, say we want to change the color of the CO2 measure. We would drag the measure CO2 kilotons to the box with the color label.\nBut what if we wanted to change the dimensions or measures? Instead of visualizing the CO2 per country, maybe we want to chart the CO2 per capita per region. To do this, we could double click on the dimension region and then do the same for the measure CO2 per capita. This builds a new chart."
