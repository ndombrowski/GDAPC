# Working with databases

## Database features

- A **database** is a collection of data stored in a computer system.
- **Relational database**: A database that contains a series of related tables that can be connected via their relationships. They allow data analysts to organize and link data based on what the data has in common. For two tables to have a relationship, one or more of the same fields must exist inside both tables. Tables in a relational database are connected by the fields they have in common.
- **Normalization** is a process of organizing data in a relational database. For example, creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables. It is applied to eliminate data redundancy, increase data integrity, and reduce complexity in a database.
- **Primary key**: A identifier that references a column in which each value is unique. n other words, it's a column of a table that is used to uniquely identify each record within that table. If you do decide to include a primary key, it should be unique, meaning no two rows can have the same primary key. Also, it cannot be null or blank.
- **Foreign key**: A field within a table that is a primary key in another table. In other words, a foreign key is how one table can be connected to another. A table can have only one primary but multiple foreign keys. These keys are what create the relationships between tables in a relational database, which helps organize and connect data across multiple tables in the database. 
- Some tables don't require a primary key
- Both primary and foreign keys connect tables in relational databases
- A primary key may also be constructed using multiple columns of a table. This type of primary key is called a **composite key**


## Managing data with metadata

- **Metadata**: Data about data but not data itself. Metadata tells you where the data comes from, when and how it was created, and what it's all about. Metadata helps data analysts interpret the contents of the data within a database. Metadata also makes data more reliable by making sure it's accurate, precise, relevant, and timely.
- Metadata helps data analysts interpret the contents of the data within a database
- Examples of parts of metadata: Title and description, tags and categories, who created it and when it was created, who last modified it and when, who can access or update it?
- A **metadata repository** is a database specifically created to store metadata.These repositories describe where metadata came from, keep it in an accessible form so it can be used quickly and easily, and keep it in a common structure for everyone who may need to use it. They:
    - Describe the state and location of metadata
    - Describe the structures of the tables inside
    - Describe how the data flows through the repository
    - Keeps track of who accesses the metadata and when

Types of metadata:

- Descriptive: Metadata that describes a piece of data and can be used to identify it at a later point in time
- Structural: Metadata that indicates how a piece of data is organized and whether it is part of one, or more than one, data collection
- Administrative: Metadata that indicates the technical source of a digital asset
