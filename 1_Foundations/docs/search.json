Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect\nProblem-orientation: Data analysts use a problem- oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems\nCorrelation: being able to identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data\nBig-picture and detail-oriented thinking: being able to see the big picture as well as the details\n\n\nLet’s talk about some of the questions data analysts ask when they’re on the hunt for a solution.\nHere’s one that will come up a lot:\n\nWhat is the root cause of a problem? A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs. A simple way to wrap your head around root causes is with the process called the Five Whys. In the Five Whys you ask “why” five times to reveal the root cause.\nWhere are the gaps in our process? For this, many people will use something called gap analysis. Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to where you want to be. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them\nWhat did we not consider before?"

They shouldn’t be used or referred to interchangeably.\n\n\n2.3.2 The data analysis process\nNow that you understand all the phases of the data life cycle, it’s time to move on to the phases of data analysis. They sound similar, but are two different things. Data analysis isn’t a life cycle. It’s the process of analyzing data.\n\n2.3.2.1 Ask step\nWe define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.\nStakeholders are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome\nDefining a problem means you look at the current state and identify how it’s different from the ideal state.\nAnother important part of the ask phase is understanding stakeholder expectations. The first step here is to determine who the stakeholders are. That may include your manager, an executive sponsor, or your sales partners.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Prepare step\nHere, the data analysts collect and store data they’ll use for the upcoming analysis process. Decisions made from your analysis should always be based on facts and be fair and impartial.\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Process step\nHere, data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more data sets to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the information. You’ll also fix typos, inconsistencies, or missing and inaccurate data\n\n\n2.3.2.4 Analysis step\nAnalyzing the data you’ve collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making\n\n\n2.3.2.5 Share step\nHere you’ll learn how data analysts interpret results and share them with others to help stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions. In the share phase, visualization is a data analyst’s best friend.\n\n\n2.3.2.6 Act step\nThis is the exciting moment when the business takes all of the insights you, the data analyst, have provided and puts them to work in order to solve the original business problem\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Data analysis tools\nThe most commonly used tools are:\n\nSpreadsheets:\n\nSpreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you Collect, store, organize, and sort information AND identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project AND create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts.\nFor example excel or google sheets.\nUses formulas, a set of instructions that performs a specific calculation using the data in a spreadsheet\nUses functions, i.e. preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet\n\nQuery languages:\n\nA query language is a computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a database\nA database is a collection of data stored in a computer system\nSequel, i.e. structured query language, SQL is a language that lets data analysts communicate with a database\nThese languages allow us to isolate specific information from a database(s), learn and understand the requests made to databases and finally allows us to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis\n\nVisualization tools:\n\nI.e. the graphical representation of information, includes graphs, maps or tables\nExample tools: Tableau, Looker\n\n\nDifferences between spreadsheets and databases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpreadsheets\nDatabases\n\n\n\n\nSoftware applications\nData stores - accessed using a query language (e.g. SQL)\n\n\nStructure data in a row and column format\nStructure data using rules and relationships\n\n\nOrganize information in cells\nOrganize information in complex collections\n\n\nProvide access to a limited amount of data\nProvide access to huge amounts of data\n\n\nManual data entry\nStrict and consistent data entry\n\n\nGenerally one user at a time\nMultiple users\n\n\nControlled by the user\nControlled by a database management system"

    "section": "3.2 SQL in action",
    "text": "3.2 SQL in action\nSQL can do lots of the same things with data that spreadsheets can do. You can use it to store, organize and analyze your data, among other things. But like any good sequel, it’s on a larger scale, bigger, more action-packed.\nQuery: A request for data or information from a database.\n\n3.2.1 Writing queries\nThe structure for a basic query looks like this\n\nYou can write your SQL queries in all lowercase and don’t have to worry about extra spaces between words. However, using capitalization and indentation can help you read the information more easily. Keep your queries neat, and they will be easier to review or troubleshoot if you need to check them later on.\n\nNotice that the SQL statement shown above has a semicolon at the end. The semicolon is a statement terminator and is part of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) SQL-92 standard, which is a recommended common syntax for adoption by all SQL databases. However, not all SQL databases have adopted or enforce the semicolon, so it’s possible you may come across some SQL statements that aren’t terminated with a semicolon. If a statement works without a semicolon, it’s fine.\n\n\n3.2.2 The where clause\nHowever, if you are looking for all customers with a last name that begins with the letters “Ch,” the WHERE clause would be:\nWHERE field1 LIKE 'Ch%'\nYou can conclude that the LIKE clause is very powerful because it allows you to tell the database to look for a certain pattern! The percent sign (%) is used as a wildcard to match one or more characters. In the example above, both Chavez and Chen would be returned. Note that in some databases an asterisk (*) is used as the wildcard instead of a percent sign (%).\n\n\n3.2.3 Adding comments\nSome tables aren’t designed with descriptive enough naming conventions. In the example, field1 was the column for a customer’s last name, but you wouldn’t know it by the name. A better name would have been something such as last_name. In these cases, you can place comments alongside your SQL to help you remember what the name represents. Comments are text placed between certain characters, /* and */, or after two dashes (–) as shown below.\n\nTwo dashes (–) are generally supported. So it is best to use – and be consistent with it. You can use # in place of – in the above query, but # is not recognized in all SQL versions; for example, MySQL doesn’t recognize #. You can also place comments between /* and */ if the database you are using supports it.\n\n\n3.2.4 Aliases\nYou can also make it easier on yourself by assigning a new name or alias to the column or table names to make them easier to work with (and avoid the need for comments). This is done with a SQL AS clause. In the example below, the alias last_name has been assigned to field1 and the alias customers assigned to table. These aliases are good for the duration of the query only. An alias doesn’t change the actual name of a column or table in the database.\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Resources\nW3Schools SQL Tutorial: If you would like to explore a detailed tutorial of SQL, this is the perfect place to start. This tutorial includes interactive examples you can edit, test, and recreate. Use it as a reference or complete the whole tutorial to practice using SQL. Click the green Start learning SQL now button or the Next button to begin the tutorial.\nSQL Cheat Sheet: For more advanced learners, go through this article for standard SQL syntax used in PostgreSQL. By the time you are finished, you will know a lot more about SQL and will be prepared to use it for business analysis and other tasks."
