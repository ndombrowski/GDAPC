## Understanding data and fairness

- **Fairness**: ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias

Sometimes conclusions based on data can be true and unfair. What can you do then? 

An ethical data analyst can look at the data gathered and conclude that the company culture is preventing some employees from succeeding, and the company needs to address those problems to boost performance.

As a data analyst it's your responsibility to make sure your analysis is fair and factors in the complicated social context that could create bias in your conclusions.
