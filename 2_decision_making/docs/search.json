    "text": "2.1 The six data analysis phases\n\n2.1.1 Ask\nIt’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:\n\nDefine the problem you’re trying to solve\nMake sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations\nFocus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions\nCollaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication\nTake a step back and see the whole situation in context\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\n\nWhat are my stakeholders saying their problems are?\nNow that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Prepare\nYou will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide:\n\nWhat metrics to measure\nLocate data in your database\nCreate security measures to protect that data\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\n\nWhat do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?\nWhat research do I need to do?\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Process\nClean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:\n\nUsing spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data\nUsing SQL functions to check for extra spaces\nRemoving repeated entries\nChecking as much as possible for bias in the data\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\n\nWhat data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?\nHow can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Analyse\nYou will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to:\n\nPerform calculations\nCombine data from multiple sources\nCreate tables with your results\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\n\nWhat story is my data telling me?\nHow will my data help me solve this problem?\nWho needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Share\nEveryone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:\n\nMake better decisions\nMake more informed decisions\nLead to stronger outcomes\nSuccessfully communicate your findings\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\n\nHow can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?\nWhat would help me understand this if I were the listener?\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Act\nNow it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\n\nHow can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?\n\nThese six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called structured thinking. This process involves four basic activities:\n\nRecognizing the current problem or situation\nOrganizing available information\nRevealing gaps and opportunities\nIdentifying your options"

    "text": "2.3 SMART questions\nHere’s an example that breaks down the thought process of turning a problem question into one or more SMART questions using the SMART method: What features do people look for when buying a new car?\n\nSpecific: Specific questions are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas. I.e. what percentage of kids achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity at least five days a week instead of asking are kids getting enough physical activities these days??\nMeasurable: Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed. An example of an unmeasurable question would be, why did a recent video go viral? Instead, you could ask how many times was our video shared on social channels the first week it was posted?\nAction-oriented: Action-oriented questions encourage change. Rather than asking, how can we get customers to recycle our product packaging? You could ask, what design features will make our packaging easier to recycle?\nRelevant: Relevant questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you’re trying to solve. Let’s say you’re working on a problem related to a threatened species of frog. And you asked, why does it matter that Pine Barrens tree frogs started disappearing? This is an irrelevant question because the answer won’t help us find a way to prevent these frogs from going extinct. A more relevant question would be, what environmental factors changed in Durham, North Carolina between 1983 and 2004 that could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear from the Sandhills Regions?\nTime-bound: Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied.\n\nQuestions should be open-ended. This is the best way to get responses that will help you accurately qualify or disqualify potential solutions to your specific problem.\n\n2.3.1 Things to avoid:\nBelow some examples of ineffective questions\n\nLeading questions: questions that only have a particular response, such as this product is too expensive, isn’t it? A better question might be, ‘What is your opinion of this product?’\nClosed-ended questions: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only, such as were you satisfied with the customer trial? This is a closed-ended question because it doesn’t encourage people to expand on their answer. It is really easy for them to give one-word responses that aren’t very informative. A better question might be, ‘What did you learn about customer experience from the trial.’\nVague questions: questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context, i.e. does the tool work for you? This question is too vague because there is no context. Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just don’t know. A better inquiry might be, ‘When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?’"

It allows its users to transform columns into rows and rows into columns.\n\n2.5.1 More about dashboards\nFor a basic idea of what dashboards look like, refer to this article: 6 real-world examples of business intelligence dashboards. Tableau is one tool that is used to create dashboards and is covered later in the program.\nOften, businesses will tailor a dashboard for a specific purpose. The three most common categories are:\n\nStrategic: focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics\nOperational: short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals\nAnalytical: consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets\n\nTo create a dashboard:\n\nIdentify the stakeholders who need to see the data and how they will use it\n\nTo get started with this, you need to ask effective questions. Check out this Requirements Gathering Worksheet to explore a wide range of good questions you can use to identify relevant stakeholders and their data needs. This is a great resource to help guide you through this process again and again.\n\nDesign the dashboard (what should be displayed)\n\nUse these tips to help make your dashboard design clear, easy to follow, and simple:\n\nUse a clear header to label the information\nAdd short text descriptions to each visualization\nShow the most important information at the top\n\n\nCreate mock-ups if desired\n\nThis is optional, but a lot of data analysts like to sketch out their dashboards before creating them.\n\nSelect the visualizations you will use on the dashboard\nCreate filters as needed\n\nFilters show certain data while hiding the rest of the data in a dashboard. This can be a big help to identify patterns while keeping the original data intact. It is common for data analysts to use and share the same dashboard, but manage their part of it with a filter. To dig deeper into filters and find an example of filters in action, you can visit Tableau’s page on Filter Actions."

Volume describes the amount of data. Variety describes the different kinds of data. Velocity describes how fast the data can be processed. Some data analysts also consider a fourth V: veracity. Veracity refers to the quality and reliability of the data. These are all important considerations related to processing huge, complex data sets."

    "section": "3.2 Formulas",
    "text": "3.2 Formulas\nA formula is a set of instructions that perform a specific calculation.\nFormulas are built on operators which are symbols that name the type of operation or calculation to be performed. For example, a plus sign is a common operator.\nIf you already have data in your spreadsheet, you can use cell references in your formulas instead. A cell reference is a single cell or range of cells in a worksheet that can be used in a formula. Cell references contain the letter of the column and the number of the row where the data is.\nA range of cells is a collection of two or more cells. A range can include cells from the same row or column, or from different columns and rows collected together.\n\n3.2.1 Auto filling\nThe lower-right corner of each cell has a fill handle. It is a small green square in Microsoft Excel and a small blue square in Google Sheets.\nClick the fill handle for a cell and drag it down a column to auto-fill other cells in the column with the same value or formula in that cell.\nClick the fill handle for a cell and drag it across a row to auto-fill other cells in the row with the same value or formula in that cell.\nIf you want to create a numbered sequence in a column or row, do the following: 1) Fill in the first two numbers of the sequence in two adjacent cells, 2) Select to highlight the cells, and 3) Drag the fill handle to the last cell to complete the sequence of numbers. For example, to insert 1 through 100 in each row of column A, enter 1 in cell A1 and 2 in cell A2. Then, select to highlight both cells, click the fill handle in cell A2, and drag it down to cell A100. This auto-fills the numbers sequentially so you don’t have to type them in each cell.\n\n\n3.2.2 Absolute referencing\nAbsolute referencing is marked by a dollar sign (\\(). For example, =\\)A$10 has absolute referencing for both the column and the row value\nRelative references (which is what you normally do e.g. “=A10”) will change anytime the formula is copied and pasted. They are in relation to where the referenced cell is located. For example if you copied “=A10” to the cell to the right it would become “=B10”. With absolute referencing “=$A\\(10” copied to the cell to the right would remain “=\\)A$10”. But if you copied $A10 to the cell below, it would change to $A11 because the row value isn’t an absolute reference.\nAbsolute references will not change when you copy and paste the formula in a different cell. The cell being referenced is always the same.\nTo easily switch between absolute and relative referencing in the formula bar, highlight the reference you want to change and press the F4 key; for example, if you want to change the absolute reference, $A$10, in your formula to a relative reference, A10, highlight $A$10 in the formula bar and then press the F4 key to make the change."

    "section": "3.3 Errors and fixes",
    "text": "3.3 Errors and fixes\n\nOne error you may encounter is the DIV error. The DIV error happens when a formula is trying to divide a value in a cell by zero or by an empty cell. To avoid this problem, we can have this spreadsheet automatically enter not applicable whenever a cell in column A contains a zero that would cause the error. To do this, we’ll use the IFERROR function. If it encounters a DIV error caused by a cell that contains the zero, the phrase “Not applicable” will be inserted.\nIn Google Sheets, ERROR tells us the formula can’t be interpreted as it is input. This is also known as a parsing error.\nAnother type of error is N/A. The N/A error tells you that the data in your formula can’t be found by the spreadsheet. Generally, this means the data doesn’t exist. This can happen if we use the VLOOKUP functions but there is a slight difference in how things are typed, i.e. almond vs almonds\nSpeaking of typos, sometimes a typo can cause a NAME error. A NAME error can happen when a formula’s name isn’t recognized or understood.\nSometimes an error is caused by inconsistent or wrong data. For instance, the NUM error tells us that a formula’s calculation can’t be performed as specified by the data. The data doesn’t make sense for that calculation.\nThe VALUE error can indicate a problem with a formula or referenced cells.\nThe REF error often comes up when cells being referenced in a formula have been deleted, thus making the formula unable to perform the calculation\n\nAs a follow-up to what you learned in the previous video, here are a few best practices and helpful tips. These strategies will help you avoid spreadsheet errors to begin with, making your life in analytics a whole lot less stressful:\n\nFilter data to make your spreadsheet less complex and busy.\nUse and freeze headers so you know what is in each column, even when scrolling.\nWhen multiplying numbers, use an asterisk (*) not an X.\nStart every formula and function with an equal sign (=).\nWhenever you use an open parenthesis, make sure there is a closed parenthesis on the other end to match.\nChange the font to something easy to read.\nSet the border colors to white so that you are working in a blank sheet.\nCreate a tab with just the raw data, and a separate tab with just the data you need.\n\n\n3.3.1 Pro tip: Spotting errors in spreadsheets with conditional formatting\nConditional formatting can be used to highlight cells a different color based on their contents. This feature can be extremely helpful when you want to locate all errors in a large spreadsheet. For example, using conditional formatting, you can highlight in yellow all cells that contain an error, and then work to fix them.\n\n3.3.1.1 In excel\n\nClick the gray triangle above row number 1 and to the left of Column A to select all cells in the spreadsheet.\nFrom the main menu, click Home, and then click Conditional Formatting to select Highlight Cell Rules > More Rules.\nFor Select a Rule Type, choose Use a formula to determine which cells to format.\nFor Format values where this formula is true, enter =ISERROR(A1).\nClick the Format button, select the Fill tab, select yellow (or any other color), and then click OK.\nClick OK to close the format rule window.\n\n\n\n3.3.1.2 In Google Sheets\n\nClick the empty rectangle above row number 1 and to the left of Column A to select all cells in the spreadsheet. In the Step-by-step in spreadsheets video, this was called the Select All button.\nFrom the main menu, click Format and select Conditional Formatting to open the Conditional format rules pane on the right.\nWhile in the Single Color tab, under Format rules, use the drop-down to select Custom formula is, enter =ISERROR(A1), select yellow (or any other color) for the formatting style, and then click Done."

It includes objectives, guidelines, deliverables, schedule, and costs. A scope of work may be included in a statement of work to help define project outcomes.\nExamples of analytics projects for beginners\n\nAn example for a SOW:\n\nDeliverable: What work is being done, and what things are being created as a result of this project? When the project is complete, what are you expected to deliver to the stakeholders? Be specific here. Will you collect data for this project? How much, or for how long?\nTimeline: The timeline is a way of mapping expectations for how long each step of the process should take. The timeline should be specific enough to help all involved decide if a project is on schedule. When will the deliverables be completed? How long do you expect the project will take to complete? If all goes as planned, how long do you expect each component of the project will take? When can we expect to reach each milestone?\nMilestones, i.e. significant tasks you will confirm along your timeline to help everyone know the project is on track. This is closely related to your timeline. What are the major milestones for progress in your project? How do you know when a given part of the project is considered complete?\nReports: Good SOWs also set boundaries for how and when you’ll give status updates to stakeholders. How will you communicate progress with stakeholders and sponsors, and how often? Will progress be reported weekly? Monthly? When milestones are completed? What information will status reports contain?\n\nSOWs should also contain information specific to what is and isn’t considered part of the project. The scope of your project is everything that you are expected to complete or accomplish, defined to a level of detail that doesn’t leave any ambiguity or confusion about whether a given task or item is part of the project or not."

    "text": "3.6 The importance of context\nA data analyst considers who, what, when, where, why, and how in order to put data into context.\nContext is the condition in which something exists or happens. Context is important in data analytics because it helps you sift through huge amounts of disorganized data and turn it into something meaningful. The fact is, data has little value if it is not paired with context.\nContext can turn raw data into meaningful information. It is very important for data analysts to contextualize their data. This means giving the data perspective by defining it. To do this, you need to identify:\n\nWho: The person or organization that created, collected, and/or funded the data collection\nWhat: The things in the world that data could have an impact on\nWhere: The origin of the data\nWhen: The time when the data was created or collected\nWhy: The motivation behind the creation or collection\nHow: The method used to create or collect it"

    "text": "4.1 Examples for stakeholders\n\n4.1.1 Executive team\nThe executive team provides strategic and operational leadership to the company. They set goals, develop strategy, and make sure that strategy is executed effectively. The executive team might include vice presidents, the chief marketing officer, and senior-level professionals who help plan and direct the company’s work. These stakeholders think about decisions at a very high level and they are looking for the headline news about your project first. They are less interested in the details.\nBut you don’t have to tackle that by yourself. Your project manager will be overseeing the progress of the entire team, and you will be giving them more regular updates than someone like the vice president of HR.\n\n\n4.1.2 Customer-facing team\nThe customer-facing team includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers. Typically they compile information, set expectations, and communicate customer feedback to other parts of the internal organization.\n\n\n4.1.3 Data science team\nOrganizing data within a company takes teamwork. There’s a good chance you’ll find yourself working with other data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. For example, maybe you team up with a company’s data science team to work on boosting company engagement to lower rates of employee turnover. In that case, you might look into the data on employee productivity, while another analyst looks at hiring data. Then you share those findings with the data scientist on your team, who uses them to predict how new processes could boost employee productivity and engagement."

    "text": "4.2 Working effectively with stakeholders\n\nDiscuss goals. Stakeholder requests are often tied to a bigger project or goal. When they ask you for something, take the opportunity to learn more. Start a discussion. Ask about the kind of results the stakeholder wants. Sometimes, a quick chat about goals can help set expectations and plan the next steps.\nFeel empowered to say no: Stakeholders don’t always realize the time and effort that goes into collecting and analyzing data. They also might not know what they actually need. You can help stakeholders by asking about their goals and determining whether you can deliver what they need\nPlan for the unexpected. Before you start a project, make a list of potential roadblocks. Then, when you discuss project expectations and timelines with your stakeholders, give yourself some extra time for problem-solving at each stage of the process.\nKnow your project. Keep track of your discussions about the project over email or reports, and be ready to answer questions about how certain aspects are important for your organization. Get to know how your project connects to the rest of the company and get involved in providing the most insight possible. If you have a good understanding about why you are doing an analysis, it can help you connect your work with other goals and be more effective at solving larger problems.\nStart with words and visuals. It is common for data analysts and stakeholders to interpret things in different ways while assuming the other is on the same page. This illusion of agreement* has been historically identified as a cause of projects going back-and-forth a number of times before a direction is finally nailed down. To help avoid this, start with a description and a quick visual of what you are trying to convey.\nCommunicate often. Your stakeholders will want regular updates on your projects. Share notes about project milestones, setbacks, and changes. Then use your notes to create a shareable report. Another great resource to use is a change-log, which you will learn more throughout the program. For now, just know that a change-log is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project. D"

    "text": "4.5 Limitations of data\n\nThe case of incomplete or missing data: To be safe, you should be up front about the incomplete dataset until that data becomes available.\nMisaligned data: If you’re collecting data from other teams and using existing spreadsheets, it is good to keep in mind that people use different business rules. So one team might define and measure things in a completely different way than another. For example, if a metric is the total number of trainees in a certificate program, you could have one team that counts every person who registered for the training, and another team that counts only the people who completed the program. In cases like these, establishing how to measure things early on standardizes the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy\nDirty data: Dirty data refers to data that contains errors. Dirty data can lead to productivity loss, unnecessary spending, and unwise decision-making. A good data cleaning effort can help you avoid this. As a quick reminder, data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When you find and fix the errors - while tracking the changes you made - you can avoid a data disaster.\n\nTell a clear story by:\n\nCompare the same types of data: Data can get mixed up when you chart it for visualization. Be sure to compare the same types of data and double check that any segments in your chart definitely display different metrics.\nVisualize with care: A 0.01% drop in a score can look huge if you zoom in close enough. To make sure your audience sees the full story clearly, it is a good idea to set your Y-axis to 0.\nLeave out needless graphs: If a table can show your story at a glance, stick with the table instead of a pie chart or a graph. Your busy audience will appreciate the clarity.\nTest for statistical significance: Sometimes two datasets will look different, but you will need a way to test whether the difference is real and important. So remember to run statistical tests to see how much confidence you can place in that difference.\nPay attention to sample size: Gather lots of data. If a sample size is small, a few unusual responses can skew the results. If you find that you have too little data, be careful about using it to form judgments. Look for opportunities to collect more data, then chart those trends over longer periods."

Sharing the agenda with everyone ahead of time helps them understand the meeting goals and prepare questions, comments, or feedback. You can email the agenda or share it using another collaboration tool.\nDuring the meeting:\nAs the leader of the meeting, it’s your job to guide the data discussion. With everyone well informed of the meeting plan and goals, you can follow these steps to avoid any distractions:\n\nMake introductions (if necessary) and review key messages\nPresent the data\nDiscuss observations, interpretations, and implications of the data\nTake notes during the meeting\nDetermine and summarize next steps for the group\n\nAfter the meeting:\nTo keep the project and everyone aligned, prepare and distribute a brief recap of the meeting with next steps that were agreed upon in the meeting. You can even take it a step further by asking for feedback from the team.\n\nDistribute any notes or data\nConfirm next steps and timeline for additional actions\nAsk for feedback (this is an effective way to figure out if you missed anything in your recap)"
