<li><strong>Stakeholders</strong> are people that have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you’ll be working on as a data analyst.</li>

<h3 data-number="4.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="executive-team"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Executive team</h3>
<p>The executive team provides strategic and operational leadership to the company. They set goals, develop strategy, and make sure that strategy is executed effectively. The executive team might include vice presidents, the chief marketing officer, and senior-level professionals who help plan and direct the company’s work. These stakeholders think about decisions at a very high level and they are looking for the headline news about your project first. They are less interested in the details.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to tackle that by yourself. Your project manager will be overseeing the progress of the entire team, and you will be giving them more regular updates than someone like the vice president of HR.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="customer-facing-team"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Customer-facing team</h3>
<p>The customer-facing team includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers. Typically they compile information, set expectations, and communicate customer feedback to other parts of the internal organization.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-science-team" class="level3" data-number="4.1.3">
<h3 data-number="4.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-science-team"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Data science team</h3>
<p>Organizing data within a company takes teamwork. There’s a good chance you’ll find yourself working with other data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. For example, maybe you team up with a company’s data science team to work on boosting company engagement to lower rates of employee turnover. In that case, you might look into the data on employee productivity, while another analyst looks at hiring data. Then you share those findings with the data scientist on your team, who uses them to predict how new processes could boost employee productivity and engagement.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-effectively-with-stakeholders"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Working effectively with stakeholders</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discuss goals. Stakeholder requests are often tied to a bigger project or goal. When they ask you for something, take the opportunity to learn more. Start a discussion. Ask about the kind of results the stakeholder wants. Sometimes, a quick chat about goals can help set expectations and plan the next steps.</li>
<li>Feel empowered to say no: Stakeholders don’t always realize the time and effort that goes into collecting and analyzing data. They also might not know what they actually need. You can help stakeholders by asking about their goals and determining whether you can deliver what they need</li>
<li>Plan for the unexpected. Before you start a project, make a list of potential roadblocks. Then, when you discuss project expectations and timelines with your stakeholders, give yourself some extra time for problem-solving at each stage of the process.</li>
<li>Know your project. Keep track of your discussions about the project over email or reports, and be ready to answer questions about how certain aspects are important for your organization. Get to know how your project connects to the rest of the company and get involved in providing the most insight possible. If you have a good understanding about why you are doing an analysis, it can help you connect your work with other goals and be more effective at solving larger problems.</li>
<li>Start with words and visuals. It is common for data analysts and stakeholders to interpret things in different ways while assuming the other is on the same page. This illusion of agreement* has been historically identified as a cause of projects going back-and-forth a number of times before a direction is finally nailed down. To help avoid this, start with a description and a quick visual of what you are trying to convey.</li>
<li>Communicate often. Your stakeholders will want regular updates on your projects. Share notes about project milestones, setbacks, and changes. Then use your notes to create a shareable report. Another great resource to use is a change-log, which you will learn more throughout the program. For now, just know that a change-log is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project. D</li>

<h2 data-number="4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communication"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Communication</h2>
<p>Before you communicate, think about:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Who your audience is?</li>
<li>What they already know?</li>
<li>What they need to know?</li>
<li>How you can effectively communicate that to them?</li>
</ol>
<p>Its important to set a reasonable and realistic timeline for the project: you’ll want to send a high-level schedule with different phases of the project and their approximate start dates</p>
<p>You want to flag problems as early as possible with your stakeholders.</p>
<p>You want to help your stakeholders achieve their goals, but it’s important to set realistic expectations at every stage of the project.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-of-data"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Limitations of data</h2>
<ul>
<li>The case of incomplete or missing data: To be safe, you should be up front about the incomplete dataset until that data becomes available.</li>
<li>Misaligned data: If you’re collecting data from other teams and using existing spreadsheets, it is good to keep in mind that people use different business rules. So one team might define and measure things in a completely different way than another. For example, if a metric is the total number of trainees in a certificate program, you could have one team that counts every person who registered for the training, and another team that counts only the people who completed the program. In cases like these, establishing how to measure things early on standardizes the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy</li>
<li>Dirty data: Dirty data refers to data that contains errors. Dirty data can lead to productivity loss, unnecessary spending, and unwise decision-making. A good data cleaning effort can help you avoid this. As a quick reminder, data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When you find and fix the errors - while tracking the changes you made - you can avoid a data disaster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell a clear story by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare the same types of data: Data can get mixed up when you chart it for visualization. Be sure to compare the same types of data and double check that any segments in your chart definitely display different metrics.</li>
<li>Visualize with care: A 0.01% drop in a score can look huge if you zoom in close enough. To make sure your audience sees the full story clearly, it is a good idea to set your Y-axis to 0.</li>
<li>Leave out needless graphs: If a table can show your story at a glance, stick with the table instead of a pie chart or a graph. Your busy audience will appreciate the clarity.</li>
<li>Test for statistical significance: Sometimes two datasets will look different, but you will need a way to test whether the difference is real and important. So remember to run statistical tests to see how much confidence you can place in that difference.</li>
<li>Pay attention to sample size: Gather lots of data. If a sample size is small, a few unusual responses can skew the results. If you find that you have too little data, be careful about using it to form judgments. Look for opportunities to collect more data, then chart those trends over longer periods.</li>
</ul>

<h2 data-number="4.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="organizing-meetings"><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Organizing meetings</h2>
<p>Before the meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify your objective. Establish the purpose, goals, and desired outcomes of the meeting, including any questions or requests that need to be addressed.</li>
<li>Acknowledge participants and keep them involved with different points of view and experiences with the data, the project, or the business.</li>
<li>Organize the data to be presented. You might need to turn raw data into accessible formats or create data visualizations.</li>
<li>Prepare and distribute an agenda.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crafting an agenda, Here are the basic parts your agenda should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting start and end time</li>
<li>Meeting location (including information to participate remotely, if that option is available)</li>
<li>Objectives</li>
<li>Background material or data the participants should review beforehand</li>
</ul>
<p>After writing your agenda, it’s time to share it with the invitees. Sharing the agenda with everyone ahead of time helps them understand the meeting goals and prepare questions, comments, or feedback. You can email the agenda or share it using another collaboration tool.</p>
<p>During the meeting:</p>
<p>As the leader of the meeting, it’s your job to guide the data discussion. With everyone well informed of the meeting plan and goals, you can follow these steps to avoid any distractions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make introductions (if necessary) and review key messages</li>
<li>Present the data</li>
<li>Discuss observations, interpretations, and implications of the data</li>
<li>Take notes during the meeting</li>
<li>Determine and summarize next steps for the group</li>
</ul>
<p>After the meeting:</p>
<p>To keep the project and everyone aligned, prepare and distribute a brief recap of the meeting with next steps that were agreed upon in the meeting. You can even take it a step further by asking for feedback from the team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribute any notes or data</li>
<li>Confirm next steps and timeline for additional actions</li>
<li>Ask for feedback (this is an effective way to figure out if you missed anything in your recap)</li>
</ul>
